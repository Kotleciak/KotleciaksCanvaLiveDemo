Hi! I created this website in blazor webassembly and it took a while but I did it. I struggled about 2 hours with deploying it. 
I hope nothing went wrong and the website didn't crashed. 
It is webassembly so first time running this app might take some seconds more to start.

I copied code of this project to other project becouse I couldn't host it here.

On the left side you change thickness of brush. On the right side you change the color of brush. On buttom you change tools like: pencil, rubber, 
drawing rectangles and drawing straight lines. Red bin resets your work, you can download your painting by clicking white arrow on the blue background next to the bin.

NOTE: It doesn't work on phones!.
